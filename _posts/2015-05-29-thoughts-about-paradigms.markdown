I graduated from Belmont U. here in Nashville, May of 2014, which as of now is a little under a year ago. I got a degree in Commercial Music as a Guitarist and my emphasis was in music technology.

Growing up, I guess you could say I was always torn between my left and right brains. But for most of my life I always sort of favored my artistic/creative side but my logical brain was always distracting me from being able to truly hone my craft as a musician.

That said I can feel justified in claiming that I put in my thousand hours as a musician but my journey through 4 years at Belmont taught me that I have an insatiable desire to work with technology but not just use create and manipulate technology, more specifically I want to change the way music is recorded.

Now I’m two months through the 6 month apprenticeship program at Nashville Software School and I had a realization.

Nothing to life shattering but anytime you start spending your life doing one thing everything else in your life seems to relate to that thing. For example before software school I used to hear the world. Anything and everything was music to me, philosophy, sound, sight, color, art, everything.

Now after a few months in code school and everything is starting to look like a program. It’s just a little wierd. Don’t really know what it means if anything but it just made me feel a little small again☺
